# Blogpost AI

I would define AI as any program that can imitate human intelligence in a given area. 

AI Technology has improved dramatically over the last decades. IBM's Deep Blue beat chess genius Kasparov in 1997. Watson won the Jeopardy game. Google Deepmind's AlphaGO beat the GO world champion Lee Sedol in 2016. After the success of AlphaGO, Deepmind went on to create AlphaZero. an Agent that would learn only by playing against itself. After learning chess for four hours, it was on a level that it could beat Stockfisch.


## AI Intelligence

AI agents can imitate human intelligence or human behaviour but they are not conscious. We are still not sure how we can define consciousness. the agent can appear to be conscious, but all it's doing is imitating a human. Agents can show emotions, but that does not mean that they feel emotions. They can create art that looks just like van Gogh without being creative. All these agents do is imitate human behavious and emotions. Every AI system is currently specialised in a single task. We don't have a general intelligence.

## Trusting AI

We need large amounts of data to create AI systems. Aditionally, the training data needs to be unbiased and uncorrelated. Our system could become biased and discriminate against women or minorities soley because we fed it the wrong training data. We could end up in a dystopian future if AI systems get too much decision-making power. Systems could derive theyr data from a survalliance state to track and score its citizens. People with a good score could prosper while the ones with a bad score could be deprived of basic human needs just because a program says they don't deserve it.

## Surveillance

Its said that data is the new oil. Companies such as Google and facebook run on data. They get as much data as posible and sell it to the highest bidder. AI systems process these huge amounts of personal data to target each one of us individually with ads and recomandations. We are being manipulated in the ways we think, what we like, what we do in our free time, and what we spend our money on. This drives us into rampant individualism and promotes more and more consumption.

## AI for good?

As discussed previously, Google and Facebook use data to make huge profits while everyone suffers from profiling and targeting. How can we guarantee that AI is used for good instead of pushing capitalism?

1. We should not underestimate the long-term effecs that AI will have in our lives. At the same time should we expect life changing innovations right away.
2. Be careful with magic. AI does not offer limitless possibilities. We should not imagine the future with techologies that are too far fetched but rather extrapolate existing technologies.
3. Just because an AI is extremely good at a specific task should we not generalize its intilligence and especially not compare it to human intelligence.
4. AI Systems are only good at the task they learned. We should not generalize theyr skills. A symple mismatch in the rules can make a system utterly useless.
5. Deep Learning made huge advances in the last 30 years. This does however not mean that the advances will continue so rapidly.
6. AI techologies will evolve over time just as our society evolves. We should not imagine our world as it is now, but with super intelligents AI agents.
7. AI innovations take a lot of time to be deployed in the field when compared to other disciplines. We should not think that a problem will be immediately solved if we develop AI systems to solve it.


I think my point in the first blog post still stands. I see that I've might been a bit too pesimistic about the future with the survalliance. If we get to the point where AI makes important decisions, our societies would have evolved in a way where this is acceptable.
